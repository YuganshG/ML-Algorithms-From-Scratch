## Coding Machine Learning Algorithms from the Ground Up

### About

Welcome to the repository! This collection features handcrafted implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms written entirely from scratch in Python. Dive into the core of machine learning as we build these algorithms step by step, providing clear insights into their inner workings. Whether you're a beginner looking to understand the fundamentals or an experienced practitioner seeking a deeper understanding, this repository is a resource for exploring the foundations of machine learning through code.

* [Linear Regression](https://github.com/yugansh77/myfolio/blob/78a6b217930263442a983518c41d6d1121ec69ad/01.%20ML%20Algos%20coded%20from%20Scratch/01.%20Linear%20Regression%20from%20Scratch.ipynb):
Wrote Linear Regression algorithm from scratch to fit a model on a basic dataset comprising profits of a company as per the population of a city
* [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/yugansh77/myfolio/blob/78a6b217930263442a983518c41d6d1121ec69ad/01.%20ML%20Algos%20coded%20from%20Scratch/02.%20Logistic%20Regresion%20from%20Scratch.ipynb):
Wrote Logistic Regression algorithm from scratch and trained it on a artifically created dummy datasest
* [K-Nearest Neighbour](https://github.com/yugansh77/myfolio/blob/78a6b217930263442a983518c41d6d1121ec69ad/01.%20ML%20Algos%20coded%20from%20Scratch/03.%20KNN%20from%20Scratch.ipynb):
Wrote KNN algorithm from scratch and used it for classification on Iris dataset. Tested the model on different values of K and one with maximum accuracy was chosen.
* [K-Means](https://github.com/yugansh77/myfolio/blob/78a6b217930263442a983518c41d6d1121ec69ad/01.%20ML%20Algos%20coded%20from%20Scratch/04.%20KMeans%20from%20Scratch.ipynb):
Wrote K-Means algorithm from scratch and used it on a artificially created dataset. Elbow method is used to pick the best K. Progress shown as each centroid recenters after each iteration.

* [Neural Networks](https://github.com/yugansh77/myfolio/blob/78a6b217930263442a983518c41d6d1121ec69ad/02.%20Neural%20Networks%20coded%20from%20Scratch/Neural%20Networks%20from%20Scratch%20using%20Numpy.ipynb):
Implemented Neural Networks completely from scratch and used it for classification on Iris dataset.
