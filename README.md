* [Linear Regression](https://github.com/yugansh77/myfolio/blob/78a6b217930263442a983518c41d6d1121ec69ad/01.%20ML%20Algos%20coded%20from%20Scratch/01.%20Linear%20Regression%20from%20Scratch.ipynb):
Wrote Linear Regression algorithm from scratch to fit a model on a basic dataset comprising profits of a company as per the population of a city
* [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/yugansh77/myfolio/blob/78a6b217930263442a983518c41d6d1121ec69ad/01.%20ML%20Algos%20coded%20from%20Scratch/02.%20Logistic%20Regresion%20from%20Scratch.ipynb):
Wrote Logistic Regression algorithm from scratch and trained it on a artifically created dummy datasest
* [K-Nearest Neighbour](https://github.com/yugansh77/myfolio/blob/78a6b217930263442a983518c41d6d1121ec69ad/01.%20ML%20Algos%20coded%20from%20Scratch/03.%20KNN%20from%20Scratch.ipynb):
Wrote KNN algorithm from scratch and used it for classification on Iris dataset. Tested the model on different values of K and one with maximum accuracy was chosen.
* [K-Means](https://github.com/yugansh77/myfolio/blob/78a6b217930263442a983518c41d6d1121ec69ad/01.%20ML%20Algos%20coded%20from%20Scratch/04.%20KMeans%20from%20Scratch.ipynb):
Wrote K-Means algorithm from scratch and used it on a artificially created dataset. Elbow method is used to pick the best K. Progress shown as each centroid recenters after each iteration.

* [Neural Networks](https://github.com/yugansh77/myfolio/blob/78a6b217930263442a983518c41d6d1121ec69ad/02.%20Neural%20Networks%20coded%20from%20Scratch/Neural%20Networks%20from%20Scratch%20using%20Numpy.ipynb):
Implemented Neural Networks completely from scratch and used it for classification on Iris dataset.
